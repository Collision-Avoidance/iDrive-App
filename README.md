## Smart Vehicle Communication System for Collision Avoidance

### Main Objective
- Create an automated communication system for collision avoidance.
- Which can share the detected collision data among nearby vehicles.
- Implement a collision detection system.

### Main Research Question
- Most of the cars doesn't have collision detection system.
- Even though some cars have the collision detection system the cars don't have a way to share those valuable information with nearby drivers.
